# Time

A simple time logger / habbit tracker.

It allows you to track how much time you spend on your hobbies and add a "rating" on each entry to signify how well it went.

## Reason for creating

I created this since I lacked a clear way of tracking my habit progress.

At time of creation I am trying to read a book a week, and I want to log how long I spend every day and if it feels tiresome to read or not.

I also am trying to learn Japanese, and what to log time and how well I perceived it went.

## Starting

Everything is in docker so simply run

```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

and the service should be available on http://localhost:3002
